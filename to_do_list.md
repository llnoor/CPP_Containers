- there is no any error message shown in original stl parameterized constructor when n is negative but i want to implement it yet i don't know how  
- max_size (= 384307168202282325) checks in:  
  - initializer list constructor  
  - push methods  
seem like not very needed technically, only logically?  
'cause couldnt create lists of size more than divided to <10 billions. possibly this number will differ on mac  
- is it necessary to check dereferenced iterators after clearing a container?

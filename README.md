# Containers

There are two main types of containers: sequence and associative containers. 
To find an element in sequence containers (`list`, `vector`, `array`, `stack`, `queue`), you can look through the container one by one, while in associative containers (`map`, `set`, `multiset`) you can look through the key associated with the value.

## Main containers

List of classes: `list`, `map`, `queue`, `set`, `stack`, `vector`.

## Additional containers

List of classes: `array`, `multiset`.
